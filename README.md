# AI-Powered-Code-Analyzer

This project leverages OpenAI Codex (or an alternative AI model) to analyze code snippets and provide optimization suggestions. It consists of a backend built with Flask and a frontend (which can be added later). The backend takes code as input, processes it using the AI model, and returns suggestions for improvement.
Features

    Backend: Built using Flask to handle API requests.
    AI Integration: Uses OpenAI Codex or an alternative AI model to analyze code and suggest optimizations.
    Frontend: A simple interface to upload code snippets and display results (optional in this version).

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

    Python (>= 3.6)
    Flask
    OpenAI API Key (or another AI service key)

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-code-analyzer.git
cd ai-code-analyzer

2. Set Up the Backend
a. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python dependencies. Create one by running:

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

    source venv/bin/activate

b. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the backend folder and install the required dependencies from requirements.txt:

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt file should include the following dependencies:

flask
openai
flask-cors
requests

c. Set Your OpenAI API Key

In app.py, replace the openai.api_key with your own OpenAI API key.

openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

If you are using another AI service, update the code to use the appropriate API key and service.
d. Run the Backend

After installing the dependencies, run the backend Flask app:

python app.py

The Flask application will be running locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
3. Frontend Setup (Optional)
a. Create the Frontend Interface

If you want to create a simple frontend to interact with the backend, you can add the following files in the frontend folder:

    index.html: A simple HTML form to upload code snippets.
    style.css: Optional styling for the frontend.

You can use JavaScript to make POST requests to the /analyze endpoint and display the results on the page.
4. Testing the API with Postman

If you don’t want to use the frontend for testing, you can use Postman to make API requests to the backend.

    Set up Postman:
        URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze
        Method: POST
        Headers:
            Content-Type: application/json
        Body (raw, JSON):

        {
          "code": "for i in range(1000000): pass",
          "language": "Python"
        }

    Send the request and view the results returned by the AI model.

Assumptions and Limitations
Assumptions:

    The backend is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/, and you have set up the correct OpenAI API key or alternative AI service key.
    The frontend (if included) allows users to input code and submit it for analysis.

Limitations:

    Free API Limits: OpenAI has a quota for free usage, which might limit the number of API requests you can make. If you hit the limit, you’ll need to upgrade to a paid plan or use another model.
    Performance: The AI model may not always provide perfect or highly accurate performance suggestions, as it depends on the complexity of the code.
    Model Availability: The project relies on a third-party API (OpenAI or another AI service). If the service is down, the application may not function properly.
    Frontend (Optional): The frontend in this repo is not fully implemented. You can create your own UI or use Postman for testing.

Notes

    Make sure to replace the OpenAI API key with your own valid key or integrate another API service key if you're using a different AI provider.
    Provide any additional clarifications or instructions based on the project's unique setup.
